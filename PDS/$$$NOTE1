Sam -
At the end of this e-mail is a note that I had
received from Sam Knutson as a result of a thread
on the AMS List Server.  Please find attached the
"EBCDIC to BASE64" encoder utility which was the
subject of that thread - and which Sam suggested I
should contribute.

I believe that now such a utility is now available from a
number of sources (for example when you obtain the XMITIP
tool) - but when I needed this utility I couldn't find
anything.

In any event - if you think there is some value in
putting this out on the CBT - you are welcome to it.  The
assembler program has a #JISTAMP macro coded in it - the
macro is included in the XMI file for those who want to
leave it in the program - or people can simply remove it
- it just puts a date:time stamp into the load module.  I
would be pleased if you can use this simple little tool -
since in the past I have downloaded material from CBT and
found it very useful.

I managed to locate some documentation which I have
included in the ZIP file - it contains a DISCLAIMER and
COPYRIGHT notice.  I hope that this is adequate for the
needs of the CBT.  (See member $$DOCO .)

If you need anything else from me - please let me know -
cheers - Gary
