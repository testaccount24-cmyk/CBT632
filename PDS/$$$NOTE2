Walking home Friday night I realised that we had called this
contribution the "EBCDIC to BASE64 Converter". In actual fact
there is no real reason to convert EBCDIC directly to BASE64 -
usually you want a file in BASE64 so you can send the file as a
MIME attachment - in which case the source file should already be
in ASCII. So there's a couple of issues:

1) Contribution is misnamed - it should simply be "BASE64
Encoder" or "Mainframe Assembler BASE64 Encoder"

2) Users who have EBCDIC files to be e-mailed as attachments
should first convert them to ASCII - so I've added in the TOASCII
and TOASCILF programs to do this (documentation upgraded) - and
also a sample job stream to show how an EBCDIC file with HTML
directives could be e-mailed as an attachment - also shown in the
$$DOCO.

This should now be a more complete offering - and ought to be of
some use to people who don't have XMITIP.

I didn't change the versioning or dates inside the documentation
entries - as this is a "new" offering.  I suppose what I've done
is just corrected the initial release of "ver 1.0" .  All of
the changes, including the new programs, have been made inside
the XMI file - so you shouldn't have too much to do to whip this
puppy into shape.

Sorry about being so vague about all of this - it was just that
the initial suggestion had focused on the BASE64 encoding - I
forgot in the rush to send it out that on it's own it might not
be particularly useful.

Cheers - Gary
